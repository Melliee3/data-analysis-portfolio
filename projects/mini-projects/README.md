## Mini Data Analysis Projects

This folder contains small-scale Python data analysis projects developed during a Data Science Summer School.

Each project focuses on practicing core data analysis skills such as:
- data cleaning and preprocessing
- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- basic visualizations
- working with real-world datasets

These projects are intentionally lightweight and are meant to demonstrate consistency, clarity, and analytical thinking.
